# Payroll-Reconciliation

Automation tool to perform analysis across 3 data sets:
1. Employer submitted payroll files via automated integration process
2. Funds being placed into participant accounts via processing of payroll files
3. Financial backend of funds received from client, and potential refunds to clients/participants

SQLs for data sets are via:
1. Employer Submission.sql
2. Transactional Recordkeeping.sql
3. Financial Backend.sql

This program provides cost saving upwards of $225,000 per annum and reduces the ETA for the analysis process from 2 weeks to 2 days.
The process moving to automation also reduces points of failure with end users, which creates redistributable results without worry of error.
In summary: client relations improved greatly, reduces labor overhead, improves turn around time, and saves hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly.
